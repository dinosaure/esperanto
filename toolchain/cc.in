# @@CONFIG_TARGET_TRIPLE@@-cc: Cosmopolitan wrapper for 'cc'.
# Generated by configure.sh at build time.
#
# Passes through to @@CONFIG_TARGET_CC@ for actual work. Defines all flags
# required for correct operation when building C code intended for inclusion in
# a Cosmopolitan artifact.
#
# Provides a '-z cosmopolitan-support-vector=bits' option which allows the user
# to choose which system he/she wants to support:
# - GNU/Systemd    (SUPPORT |= 0b0000001)
# - Bare Metal     (SUPPORT |= 0b0000010)
# - Windows        (SUPPORT |= 0b0000100)
# - XNU's Not Unix (SUPPORT |= 0b0001000)
# - OpenBSD        (SUPPORT |= 0b0010000)
# - FreeBSD        (SUPPORT |= 0b0100000)
# - NetBSD         (SUPPORT |= 0b1000000)
# ABI defaults to '0b1111111' to support all systems.

# We introspect -g option and if we want to compile an assembler code. If -g
# if already set, we don't add it and if we want to compile an assembler code
# (a *.s file), we don't even add it (for binutils.2.34, it seems that a call
# to GCC with -g leads to an error "file number 1 already allocated" because
# OCaml emits something on this table, GCC wants to emit something on this
# table and [as] wants to emit something too... - the error disappears with
# binutils.2.36).
